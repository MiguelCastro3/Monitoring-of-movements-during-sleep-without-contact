# Monitoring of movements during sleep without contact

**PROJECT:** 

Creation of a device for monitoring movements during sleep, without contact with the user (embedded system), with the aim, for example, of providing data indicating the presence of some pathology, such as disturbance of periodic limb movements and the restless legs syndrome. As a main electronic component, a microwave motion sensor was used.

**STEPS:** 

* Construction of the schematic circuit for the microwave sensor (HB100) and processing of its signal;
* Construction of the schematic circuit for the remaining monitoring device. For this, an Arduino, a clock (RTC DS1307), a humidity and temperature sensor (DHT11), an LCD (Nokia 5110), a buzzer, a bluetooth module were used and a power supply;
* Arduino programming, in C ++, for signal processing and the appropriate response;
* Development of a prototype case to protect the entire circuit.
