# Monitoring of movements during sleep without contact

**PROJECT:** 

Creation of a virtual cane (embedded system), without contact with the ground, in order to assist the gait of a blind person.

**STEPS:** 

* Construction of the schematic circuit of the project, which included: Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, two types of alarms (audible and vibrating) and power supply;
* Arduino programming, in C ++, for signal processing and respective appropriate response;
* Development of a prototype case to protect the entire circuit.

**SCHEMATIC CIRCUIT:**
